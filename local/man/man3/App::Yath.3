.SH NAME
App::Yath \- Yet Another Test Harness (Test2\-Harness) Command Line Interface
(CLI)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is the primary documentation for \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR, App::Yath, Test2::Harness.
.PP
The canonical source of up-to-date command options are the help output when
using \f(CW\*(C`$ yath help\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$ yath help COMMAND\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This document is mainly an overview of \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR usage and common recipes.
.PP
App::Yath is an alternative to App::Prove, and Test2::Harness is an alternative to Test::Harness. It is not designed to
replace Test::Harness/prove. Test2::Harness is designed to take full
advantage of the rich data Test2 can provide. Test2::Harness is also able to
use non-core modules and provide more functionality than prove can achieve with
its restrictions.
.SH "PLATFORM SUPPORT"
.IX Header "PLATFORM SUPPORT"
Test2::Harness/App::Yath is is focused on unix-like platforms. Most
development happens on linux, but bsd, macos, etc should work fine as well.
.PP
Patches are welcome for any/all platforms, but the primary author (Chad
\&'Exodist' Granum) does not directly develop against non-unix platforms.
.SS WINDOWS
.IX Subsection "WINDOWS"
Currently windows is not supported, and it is known that the package will not
install on windows. Patches are be welcome, and it would be great if someone
wanted to take on the windows-support role, but it is not a primary goal for
the project.
.SH OVERVIEW
.IX Header "OVERVIEW"
To use Test2::Harness, you use the \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR command. Yath will find the tests
(or use the ones you specify) and run them. As it runs, it will output
diagnostic information such as failures. At the end, yath will print a summary
of the test run.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR can be thought of as a more powerful alternative to \f(CW\*(C`prove\*(C'\fR
(Test::Harness)
.SH RECIPES
.IX Header "RECIPES"
These are common recipes for using \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR.
.SS "RUN PROJECT TESTS"
.IX Subsection "RUN PROJECT TESTS"
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath
.Ve
.PP
Simply running yath with no arguments means "Run all tests for the current
project". Yath will look for tests in \f(CW\*(C`./t\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`./t2\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`./test.pl\*(C'\fR and
run any which are found.
.PP
Normally this implies the \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR command but will instead imply the \f(CW\*(C`run\*(C'\fR
command if a persistent test runner is detected.
.SS "PRELOAD MODULES"
.IX Subsection "PRELOAD MODULES"
Yath has the ability to preload modules. Yath normally forks to start new
tests, so preloading can reduce the time spent loading modules over and over in
each test.
.PP
Note that some tests may depend on certain modules not being loaded. In these
cases you can add the \f(CW\*(C`# HARNESS\-NO\-PRELOAD\*(C'\fR directive to the top of the test
files that cannot use preload.
.PP
\fISIMPLE PRELOAD\fR
.IX Subsection "SIMPLE PRELOAD"
.PP
Any module can be preloaded:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath \-PMoose
.Ve
.PP
You can preload as many modules as you want:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath \-PList::Util \-PScalar::Util
.Ve
.PP
\fICOMPLEX PRELOAD\fR
.IX Subsection "COMPLEX PRELOAD"
.PP
If your preload is a subclass of Test2::Harness::Runner::Preload then more
complex preload behavior is possible. See those docs for more info.
.SS LOGGING
.IX Subsection "LOGGING"
\fIRECORDING A LOG\fR
.IX Subsection "RECORDING A LOG"
.PP
You can turn on logging with a flag. The filename of the log will be printed at
the end.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ yath \-L
\&    ...
\&    Wrote log file: test\-logs/2017\-09\-12~22:44:34~1505281474~25709.jsonl
.Ve
.PP
The event log can be quite large. It can be compressed with bzip2.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ yath \-B
\&    ...
\&    Wrote log file: test\-logs/2017\-09\-12~22:44:34~1505281474~25709.jsonl.bz2
.Ve
.PP
gzip compression is also supported.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ yath \-G
\&    ...
\&    Wrote log file: test\-logs/2017\-09\-12~22:44:34~1505281474~25709.jsonl.gz
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-B\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-G\*(C'\fR both imply \f(CW\*(C`\-L\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIREPLAYING FROM A LOG\fR
.IX Subsection "REPLAYING FROM A LOG"
.PP
You can replay a test run from a log file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath test\-logs/2017\-09\-12~22:44:34~1505281474~25709.jsonl.bz2
.Ve
.PP
This will be significantly faster than the initial run as no tests are actually
being executed. All events are simply read from the log, and processed by the
harness.
.PP
You can change display options and limit rendering/processing to specific test
jobs from the run:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath test\-logs/2017\-09\-12~22:44:34~1505281474~25709.jsonl.bz2 \-v [TEST UUID(S)]
.Ve
.PP
Note: This is done using the \f(CW\*(C`$ yath replay ...\*(C'\fR command. The \f(CW\*(C`replay\*(C'\fR
command is implied if the first argument is a log file.
.SS "PER-TEST TIMING DATA"
.IX Subsection "PER-TEST TIMING DATA"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR option will cause each test file to report how long it took to run.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath \-T
\&
\&    ( PASSED )  job  1    t/yath_script.t
\&    (  TIME  )  job  1    Startup: 0.07692s | Events: 0.01170s | Cleanup: 0.00190s | Total: 0.09052s
.Ve
.SS "PERSISTENT RUNNER"
.IX Subsection "PERSISTENT RUNNER"
yath supports starting a yath session that waits for tests to run. This is very
useful when combined with preload.
.PP
\fISTARTING\fR
.IX Subsection "STARTING"
.PP
This starts the server. Many options available to the 'test' command will work
here but not all. See \f(CW\*(C`$ yath help start\*(C'\fR for more info.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath start
.Ve
.PP
\fIRUNNING\fR
.IX Subsection "RUNNING"
.PP
This will run tests using the persistent runner. By default, it will search for
tests just like the 'test' command. Many options available to the \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR
command will work for this as well. See \f(CW\*(C`$ yath help run\*(C'\fR for more details.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath run
.Ve
.PP
\fISTOPPING\fR
.IX Subsection "STOPPING"
.PP
Stopping a persistent runner is easy.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath stop
.Ve
.PP
\fIINFORMATIONAL\fR
.IX Subsection "INFORMATIONAL"
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`which\*(C'\fR command will tell you which persistent runner will be used. Yath
searches for the persistent runner in the current directory, then searches in
parent directories until it either hits the root directory, or finds the
persistent runner tracking file.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath which
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`watch\*(C'\fR command will tail the runner's log files.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath watch
.Ve
.PP
\fIPRELOAD + PERSISTENT RUNNER\fR
.IX Subsection "PRELOAD + PERSISTENT RUNNER"
.PP
You can use preloads with the \f(CW\*(C`yath start\*(C'\fR command. In this case, yath will
track all the modules pulled in during preload. If any of them change, the
server will reload itself to bring in the changes. Further, modified modules
will be blacklisted so that they are not preloaded on subsequent reloads. This
behavior is useful if you are actively working on a module that is normally
preloaded.
.SS "MAKING YOUR PROJECT ALWAYS USE YATH"
.IX Subsection "MAKING YOUR PROJECT ALWAYS USE YATH"
.Vb 1
\&    $ yath init
.Ve
.PP
The above command will create \f(CW\*(C`test.pl\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`test.pl\*(C'\fR is automatically run by
most build utils, in which case only the exit value matters. The generated
\&\f(CW\*(C`test.pl\*(C'\fR will run \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR and execute all tests in the \f(CW\*(C`./t\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`./t2\*(C'\fR
directories. Tests in \f(CW\*(C`./t\*(C'\fR will ALSO be run by prove but tests in \f(CW\*(C`./t2\*(C'\fR
will only be run by yath.
.SS "PROJECT-SPECIFIC YATH CONFIG"
.IX Subsection "PROJECT-SPECIFIC YATH CONFIG"
You can write a \f(CW\*(C`.yath.rc\*(C'\fR file. The file format is very simple. Create a
\&\f(CW\*(C`[COMMAND]\*(C'\fR section to start the configuration for a command and then
provide any options normally allowed by it. When \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR is run inside your
project, it will use the config specified in the rc file, unless overridden
by command line options.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR You can also add pre-command options by placing them at the top of
your config file \fIBEFORE\fR any \f(CW\*(C`[cmd]\*(C'\fR markers.
.PP
Comments start with a semi-colon.
.PP
Example .yath.rc:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-pFoo ; Load the \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq plugin before dealing with commands.
\&
\&    [test]
\&    \-B ;Always write a bzip2\-compressed log
\&
\&    [start]
\&    \-PMoose ;Always preload Moose with a persistent runner
.Ve
.PP
This file is normally committed into the project's repo.
.PP
\fISPECIAL PATH PSEUDO-FUNCTIONS\fR
.IX Subsection "SPECIAL PATH PSEUDO-FUNCTIONS"
.PP
Sometimes you want to specify files relative to the .yath.rc so that the config
option works from any subdirectory of the project. Other times you may wish to
use a shell expansion. Sometimes you want both!
.IP rel(path/to/file) 4
.IX Item "rel(path/to/file)"
.Vb 2
\&    \-I rel(path/to/extra_lib)
\&    \-I=rel(path/to/extra_lib)
.Ve
.Sp
This will take the path to \f(CW\*(C`.yath.rc\*(C'\fR and prefix it to the path inside
\&\f(CWrel(...)\fR. If for example you have \f(CW\*(C`/project/.yath.rc\*(C'\fR then the path would
become \f(CW\*(C`/project/path/to/extra_lib\*(C'\fR.
.IP glob(path/*/file) 4
.IX Item "glob(path/*/file)"
.Vb 2
\&    \-\-default\-search glob(subprojects/*/t)
\&    \-\-default\-search=glob(subprojects/*/t)
.Ve
.Sp
This will add a \f(CW\*(C`\-\-default\-search $_\*(C'\fR for every item found in the glob. This
uses the perl builtin function \f(CWglob()\fR under the hood.
.IP relglob(path/*/file) 4
.IX Item "relglob(path/*/file)"
.Vb 2
\&    \-\-default\-search relglob(subprojects/*/t)
\&    \-\-default\-search=relglob(subprojects/*/t)
.Ve
.Sp
Same as \f(CWglob()\fR except paths are relative to the \f(CW\*(C`.yath.rc\*(C'\fR file.
.SS "PROJECT-SPECIFIC YATH CONFIG USER OVERRIDES"
.IX Subsection "PROJECT-SPECIFIC YATH CONFIG USER OVERRIDES"
You can add a \f(CW\*(C`.yath.user.rc\*(C'\fR file. Format is the same as the regular
\&\f(CW\*(C`.yath.rc\*(C'\fR file. This file will be read in addition to the regular config
file. Directives in this file will come AFTER the directives in the primary
config so it may be used to override config.
.PP
This file should not normally be committed to the project repo.
.SS "HARNESS DIRECTIVES INSIDE TESTS"
.IX Subsection "HARNESS DIRECTIVES INSIDE TESTS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR will recognise a number of directive comments placed near the top of
test files. These directives should be placed after the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR line but
before any real code.
.PP
Real code is defined as any line that does not start with use, require, BEGIN, package, or #

.IX Subsection "HARNESS-NO-PRELOAD"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&    # HARNESS\-NO\-PRELOAD
.Ve
.PP
Use this if your test will fail when modules are preloaded. This will tell yath
to start a new perl process to run the script instead of forking with preloaded
modules.
.PP
Currently this implies HARNESS-NO-FORK, but that may not always be the case.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-NO-FORK\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-NO-FORK"
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
\&    # HARNESS\-NO\-FORK
.Ve
.PP
Use this if your test file cannot run in a forked process, but instead must be
run directly with a new perl process.
.PP
This implies HARNESS-NO-PRELOAD.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-NO-STREAM\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-NO-STREAM"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR usually uses the Test2::Formatter::Stream formatter instead of TAP.
Some tests depend on using a TAP formatter. This option will make \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR use
Test2::Formatter::TAP or Test::Builder::Formatter.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-NO-IO-EVENTS\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-NO-IO-EVENTS"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR can be configured to use the Test2::Plugin::IOEvents plugin. This
plugin replaces STDERR and STDOUT in your test with tied handles that fire off
proper Test2::Event's when they are printed to. Most of the time this is not
an issue, but any fancy tests or modules which do anything with STDERR or
STDOUT other than print may have really messy errors.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR This plugin is disabled by default, so you only need this directive if
you enable it globally but need to turn it back off for select tests.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-NO-TIMEOUT\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-NO-TIMEOUT"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR will usually kill a test if no events occur within a timeout (default
60 seconds). You can add this directive to tests that are expected to trip the
timeout, but should be allowed to continue.
.PP
NOTE: you usually are doing the wrong thing if you need to set this. See:
\&\f(CW\*(C`HARNESS\-TIMEOUT\-EVENT\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-TIMEOUT-EVENT 60\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-TIMEOUT-EVENT 60"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR can be told to alter the default event timeout from 60 seconds to another
value. This is the recommended alternative to HARNESS-NO-TIMEOUT
.PP
\fIHARNESS-TIMEOUT-POSTEXIT 15\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-TIMEOUT-POSTEXIT 15"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR can be told to alter the default POSTEXIT timeout from 15 seconds to another value.
.PP
Sometimes a test will fork producing output in the child while the parent is
allowed to exit. In these cases we cannot rely on the original process exit to
tell us when a test is complete. In cases where we have an exit, and partial
output (assertions with no final plan, or a plan that has not been completed)
we wait for a timeout period to see if any additional events come into
.PP
\fIHARNESS-DURATION-LONG\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-DURATION-LONG"
.PP
This lets you tell \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR that the test file is long-running. This is
primarily used when concurrency is turned on in order to run longer tests
earlier, and concurrently with shorter ones. There is also a \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR option to
skip all long tests.
.PP
This duration is set automatically if HARNESS-NO-TIMEOUT is set.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-DURATION-MEDIUM\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-DURATION-MEDIUM"

.PP
\fIHARNESS-DURATION-SHORT\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-DURATION-SHORT"

This lets you tell \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR That the test is short.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-CATEGORY-ISOLATION\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-CATEGORY-ISOLATION"
.PP
This lets you tell \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR that the test cannot be run concurrently with other
tests. Yath will hold off and run these tests one at a time after all other
tests.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-CATEGORY-IMMISCIBLE\fR
.IX Subsection "HARNESS-CATEGORY-IMMISCIBLE"
.PP
This lets you tell \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR that the test cannot be run concurrently with other
tests of this class. This is helpful when you have multiple tests which would
otherwise have to be run sequentially at the end of the run.
.PP
Yath prioritizes running these tests above HARNESS-CATEGORY-LONG.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-CATEGORY-GENERAL\fR

.PP
This is the default category.
.PP
\fIHARNESS-CONFLICTS-XXX\fR

same time as this one. You are able to set multiple conflict types and \f(CW\*(C`yath\*(C'\fR
will honor them.

.SH "MODULE DOCS"
.IX Header "MODULE DOCS"
This section documents the App::Yath module itself.
.SS SYNOPSIS
.IX Subsection "SYNOPSIS"
In practice you should never need to write your own yath script, or construct
an App::Yath instance, or even access themain instance when yath is running.
However some aspects of doing so are documented here for completeness.
.PP
A minimum yath script looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    BEGIN {
\&        package App::Yath:Script;
\&
\&        require Time::HiRes;
\&        require App::Yath;
\&        require Test2::Harness::Settings;
\&
\&        my $settings = Test2::Harness::Settings\->new(
\&            harness => {
\&                orig_argv       => [@ARGV],
\&                orig_inc        => [@INC],
\&                script          => _\|_FILE_\|_,
\&                start           => Time::HiRes::time(),
\&                version         => $App::Yath::VERSION,
\&            },
\&        );
\&
\&        my $app = App::Yath\->new(
\&            argv    => \e@ARGV,
\&            config  => {},
\&            settings => $settings,
\&        );
\&
\&        $app\->generate_run_sub(\*(AqApp::Yath::Script::run\*(Aq);
\&    }
\&
\&    exit(App::Yath::Script::run());
.Ve
.PP
It is important that most logic live in a BEGIN block. This is so that
goto::file can be used post-fork to execute a test script.
.PP
The actual yath script is significantly more complicated with the following behaviors:
