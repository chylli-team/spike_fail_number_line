.SH NAME
Test2::Manual::Anatomy::Context \- Internals documentation for the Context
objects.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document explains how the Test2::API::Context object works.
.SH "WHAT IS THE CONTEXT OBJECT?"
.IX Header "WHAT IS THE CONTEXT OBJECT?"
The context object is one of the key components of Test2, and makes many
features possible that would otherwise be impossible. Every test tool starts by
getting a context, and ends by releasing the context. A test tool does all its
work between getting and releasing the context. The context instance is the
primary interface for sending events to the Test2 stack. Finally the context
system is responsible for tracking what file and line number a tool operates
on, which is critical for debugging.
.SS "PRIMARY INTERFACE FOR TEST TOOLS"
.IX Subsection "PRIMARY INTERFACE FOR TEST TOOLS"
Nearly every Test2 based tool should start by calling \f(CW$ctx =
Test2::API::context()\fR in order to get a context object, and should end by
calling \f(CW\*(C`$ctx\->release()\*(C'\fR. Once a tool has its context object it can call
methods on the object to send events or have other effects. Nearly everything a
test tool needs to do should be done through the context object.
.SS "TRACK FILE AND LINE NUMBERS FOR ERROR REPORTING"
.IX Subsection "TRACK FILE AND LINE NUMBERS FOR ERROR REPORTING"
When you call \f(CW\*(C`Test2::API::Context\*(C'\fR a new context object will be returned. If
there is already a context object in effect (from a different point in the
stack) you will get a clone of the existing one. If there is not already a
current context then a completely new one will be generated. When a new context
is generated Test2 will determine the file name and line number for your test
code, these will be used when reporting any failures.
.PP
Typically the file and line number will be determined using \f(CWcaller()\fR to look
at your tools caller. The \f(CW$Test::Builder::Level\fR will be respected if
detected, but is discouraged in favor of just using context objects at every
level.
.PP
When calling \f(CWTest2::API::Context()\fR you can specify the
\&\f(CW\*(C`level => $count\*(C'\fR arguments if you need to look at a deeper caller.
.SS "PRESERVE $?, $!, $^E AND $@"
.IX Subsection "PRESERVE $?, $!, $^E AND $@"
When you call \f(CWTest2::API::context()\fR the current values of \f(CW$?\fR, \f(CW$!\fR,
\&\f(CW$^E\fR, and \f(CW$@\fR are stored in the context object itself. Whenever the context
is released the original values of these variables will be restored. This
protects the variables from any side effects caused by testing tools.
.SS "FINALIZE THE API STATE"
.IX Subsection "FINALIZE THE API STATE"
Test2::API works via a hidden singleton instance of Test2::API::Instance.
The singleton has some state that is not set in stone until the last possible
minute. The last possible minute happens to be the first time a context is
acquired. State includes IPC instance, Formatter class, Root PID, etc.
.SS "FIND/CREATE THE CURRENT/ROOT HUB"
.IX Subsection "FIND/CREATE THE CURRENT/ROOT HUB"
Test2 has a stack of hubs, the stack can be accessed via
Test2::API::test2_stack. When you get a context it will find the current
hub, if there is no current hub then the root one will be initialized.
.SS "PROVIDE HOOKS"
.IX Subsection "PROVIDE HOOKS"
There are hooks that run when contexts are created, found, and released. See
Test2::API for details on these hooks and how to use them.
